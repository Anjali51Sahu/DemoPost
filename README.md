Posts List view : 
● Show a main list of posts 
● Each post preview should display: 
○ Title of post 
○ Username of post creator 
● Clicking on the username should lead to the User view 
● Clicking anywhere else on the post preview should lead to the individual Post view 
Individual Post view: 
● Show post overview 
○ Title of post 
○ Username of post creator 
● Show a list of post comments containing: 
○ Subject of comment 
○ Comment body 
○ Email contact of the commenter 
Individual User view: 
● Show user details 
○ username full name email website company details 
Implement a search feature that allows the user to search for any user:(Optional & Addon) 
Evaluation Factors: 
● we are looking for overall use of best practices 
● UX polish is not a priority (but any included features should be usable) ● Code quality/structure will be evaluated 
● Completeness is a plus, but it is not a problem if not all features can be worked in
Minimum Requirement: 
● Navigation library can be your choice and would be great if you make use of react-navigation or react-router-flux or react- native-navigation ● Use react hooks wherever possible 
Plus points: 
● At least use one state management library either Redux or Mobx ● Would be great if you have written your own API utility to consume rest API’s ● Avoid Third-party packages usage as much as possible
